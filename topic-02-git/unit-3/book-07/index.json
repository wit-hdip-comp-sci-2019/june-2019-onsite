Axe murderers hate fix-up commits.\n* Golden rule: Never rewrite history on shared/public branches\n\n# Visualise\n\nRebasing and Merging are two methods that achieve the same goal - the integration of changes from one branch into another branch\n\n\n![rebase on master](img/01.gif)\n![rebase on feature](img/02.gif)\n"
